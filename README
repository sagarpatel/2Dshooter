REQUIREMENTS: 
				-  .NET Framework 3.5 Redistributable.
				-  Framework Redistributable 3.1.

				OR
				If you have XNA Game Studio 3.1 installed, it should include the above and you could play around with the source code and recompile.


HOW TO PLAY:
				- Locate the 2Dshooter.exe, it is located in \2Dshooter\2Dshooter\bin\x86\Debug
				However, this .exe may not be up to date.
				To ensure you are playing the latest version, run the source code from Visual Studio.
				Errors may occur when trying to compile, this is because I tend to only update the source code, and not the Visual Studio files. 
				Most likely error would be something like "Error loading "Audio\golbat_scream". File not found."
				The actual file is in there, but Visual Studio won't see it unless the file is added to the project officially.
				To do so, go the the Solution Explorer bar, right-click on the "Audio" folder --> Add --> Existing Item then select the file.

	CONTROLS:

	I recommend using an Xbox 360 controller

	KEYBOARD:
				- "Enter" key to start game at menu screen
				- "WASD" controls player movement
				- Arrow keys control gravity well
				- "G" to fire weapon
				- "E" to teleport gravity ball in front of the player
				- "R" to reset position of player, gravity weapon and enemies
				- "T" to toggle full screen

	Xbox 360 controller:

				- "START" button to start game at menu screen
				- Left analog stick controls player movement
				- Right analog stick controls gravity well
				- Right trigger to fire weapon
				- "X" to teleport gravity ball in front of the player, Hold it to keep it in front of player
				- "Down" on the D-Pad to reset position of player, gravity weapon and enemies
				- "Up" on the D-Pad to toggle full screen


	
	TIPS:
			"Charge Up" the gravity well with the weapon(pokeballs) ("G" or right trigger)
			Then move the gravity well around and the pokeballs will follow
			Only the pokeballs can destroy enemies.

			There a fix number of active pokeballs at a time.
			Pokeballs will eventually fade away and disappear.
	
	PRO-TIP:
			Charge up the gravity well far away from you.
			Then, teleport the gravity well("E" or "X" on Xbox controller)
			This will pull all the pokeballs back ==> massive damage!
